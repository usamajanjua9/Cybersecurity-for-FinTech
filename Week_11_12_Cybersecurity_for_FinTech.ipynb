        "\n",
        "**Definition:**\n",
        "Credential stuffing is a type of cyberattack where hackers use **stolen usernames and passwords from one site** to try and log in to other websites (like banking apps, wallets, etc.).\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Users often **reuse the same password** on multiple sites.\n",
        "* If one site is hacked (like a shopping app), attackers use that same login info on banking or FinTech platforms.\n",
        "* Automated bots are used to try **thousands of login attempts**.\n",

        "**Example Scenario:**\n",
        "An attacker gets login credentials from a leaked food delivery app. They use them to try logging into a digital wallet app — and if the user reused the password, the attacker gets access.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Financial accounts have **direct access to money**.\n",
        "* Attackers can **transfer funds**, apply for loans, or access personal info.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Defense Tips:**\n",
        "- ✅ Always use **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**.\n",
        "- ✅ Enforce **rate limiting** on login attempts.\n",
        "- ✅ Use **breach detection APIs** (like HaveIBeenPwned).\n",
