        "  Authentication is the process of **verifying the identity** of a user or system.  \n",
        "  In simple words → **\"Are you really who you claim to be?\"**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Examples in Daily Life:**  \n",
        "  - Showing your ID card to enter a university 🎓  \n",
        "  - Unlocking your phone with a fingerprint or PIN 📱  \n",
        "  - Logging into your Gmail with a password 📧  \n",
        "\n",
        "- **FinTech Example:**  \n",
        "  - When you open your mobile wallet app, entering your **PIN or fingerprint** is authentication.  \n",

        "  1. **Read-only** (you can view account balance).  \n",

        "  3. **Admin rights** (bank manager can approve large transactions).  \n",

        "- **FinTech Example:**  \n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Compliance with Regulations 📜**  \n",
        "   - Financial institutions must follow laws (like **PCI-DSS, GDPR**) that require strict authentication and access control.  \n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Maintaining Customer Trust 🤝**  \n",
        "   - A single breach can destroy trust.  \n",
        "   - Strong authentication (like 2FA) and proper access controls ensure **safe, reliable digital banking**.  \n",

        "2. **Salting**  \n",

        "\n",
        "- **Definition:**  \n",
        "  OAuth (Open Authorization) is a protocol that allows a user to **grant a third-party app limited access** to their resources **without sharing their password**.  \n",
        "\n",
        "👉 Example:  \n",
        "- You want to use a budgeting app 📊 that needs access to your bank account transactions.  \n",
        "- With OAuth, you log in to your bank directly, approve access, and the app only gets a **token** (not your username/password).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Analogy:**  \n",
        "- Imagine leaving your car at a valet 🚗.  \n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Resource Owner (User)** → The person who owns the data (e.g., customer).  \n",
        "2. **Client (App)** → The application requesting access (e.g., FinTech budgeting app).  \n",
        "3. **Authorization Server** → Issues tokens after user approval (e.g., Google, Bank’s auth server).  \n",
        "4. **Resource Server** → Holds the protected data (e.g., banking API).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Step-by-Step Flow:**  \n",
        "1. Client app asks user for permission.  \n",
        "2. User authenticates with Authorization Server.  \n",
        "3. Authorization Server issues an **Access Token** to the Client.  \n",
        "4. Client uses token to access data from Resource Server.  \n",
        "\n",
        "👉 The user’s **password is never shared** with the client app.  \n",

        "- **Solution:** OpenID Connect (OIDC) is built on top of OAuth 2.0 to add **identity verification**.  \n",
