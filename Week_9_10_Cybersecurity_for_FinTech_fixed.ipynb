        "\n",
        "#### \ud83d\udccc Key Terms:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Port**: A communication endpoint (e.g., port 80 for HTTP, port 443 for HTTPS).\n",
        "* **Open port**: A service is actively listening.\n",
        "* **Closed port**: Nothing is listening, but it is reachable.\n",
        "* **Filtered port**: A firewall or rule is blocking the connection, making the port unreachable.\n",

        "1. You **send a request** to that port on a server.\n",
