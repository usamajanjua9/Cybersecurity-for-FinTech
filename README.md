## üìå Course Description

This course introduces the **principles and practical techniques of cybersecurity**, with a focus on **financial technology (FinTech) systems**. Students begin with the CIA triad, threat modeling, and OSI/TCP-IP security concepts before moving into cryptography, secure communications, ethical hacking, and compliance standards.

Key focus areas include:

* Cyber-attacks: phishing, DDoS, ransomware, insider threats
* Cryptography: symmetric (AES/DES), asymmetric (RSA/ECC), hashing & PKI
* Authentication: passwords, 2FA, OAuth, RBAC
* Network & Web Security: firewalls, VPN, DNSSEC, HTTPS
* Secure communications: TLS/SSL, email security
* FinTech-specific security: wallets, APIs, digital KYC, payment systems
* Security frameworks: NIST, ISO27001, GDPR, PCIDSS
* Tools & Labs: Wireshark, Kali Linux, Python scripting, TryHackMe, HackTheBox

The course blends **theory, labs, case studies, and projects**, culminating in a secure app or FinTech security audit.
